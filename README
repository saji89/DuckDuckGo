What is Duck Duck Go?
DuckDuckGo is a search engine.
Use it instead of Google for:
  • Zero-click Info
    → Answers above the links.
  • Privacy
    → Google tracks you. We don't.
  • Goodies
    → Special searches, !bangs & settings.
  • Less Spam
    → We ban sites with just ads. 

Duck Duck Go is a search engine like Google. Use it to get more Zero-click Info, more privacy, less spam, !bang syntax and lots of other goodies.  See our about page for details.
